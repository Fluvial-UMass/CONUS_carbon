This folder contains lookup tables to run the pipeline. It does not contain any of the datasets, of which are publically available.

There is also a notes file (*README_Indiana.Rmd*) that explains how we 'fixed' the hydrography in Indiana. Please see the manuscript for more details on all of this.

Consult the R functions for the specific file names for the additional data needed to run the code. The two files you would need to add to this folder are:

- [Rocher-Ros, et al. 2019 dataset](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10108)
- [U.S. Census Bureau cartographic boundary shapefile for the U.S.](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)
